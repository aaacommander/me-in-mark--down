 This playlist has songs that I have enjoyed a lot over the past year and have shaped up to be some of my favorites. Among these mostly contain the genre of Rap which has been a favorite of mine for quite the time. Although my favorite artist is Bad Bunny.

## Creative Endeavors

In my spare time if I'm not watching TV or playing video games I'm drawing. Now I did infact bring that up earlier but here's a background on how I gained that hobby. As a kid I would always doodle on my homework or class assignments as a normal person. But I didnt just want to doodle on the side of papers, I wanted to make drawings that could fill up the whole page. So I would on my spare time draw whatever I came up with, and overtime I would learn to improve and watch youtube on tips for how to improve on things such as shading and how to add proportions along with scaling. And here I am currently learning digital art which has been fun, I enjoy it more than the traditional way of doing things.
